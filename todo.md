#To-do list for ACTman.
- [ ] Update daily savings time method
- [ ] Make plot_actogram responsive to datalength, instead of the current method limiting (and requiring) it to 14 days.
- [ ] For sleepvariables select the night in sleeplog based on date, instead of rownr.
- [ ] Report actogram / data files based on filename, instead of iteration number.
- [ ] Match sleeplog with data file based on filename, instead of iteration number.
